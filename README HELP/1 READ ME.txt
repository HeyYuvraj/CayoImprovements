Back story: 

The Cayo Perico Island was designed by Rockstar Games for Grand Theft Auto Online heists, therefore it is dark for the purpose of stealth.

Many people in FiveM like to roleplay, and I didn't like how dark the island was, or the fact that you needed a hopper just to visit the island,
so I added lights and many improvments, as well as requesting the native that
Rockstar Games uses to enable and disable the island, depending on where the player is on the map.

I do not in any way shape or form, claim the Cayo Perico Island, its assets or its' files as my own intellectual property.

All credits go to Rockstar Games, Taketwo Interactive, OpenIV, Codewalker, and MAFINS Menyoo trainer.

IMPORTANT NOTE:

TVs are to work with PMMS.

PMMS: https://github.com/kibook/pmms


if you want the TV at the beach party to fade out nicely at a certain point, try these settings, then go to advanced settings and save it as an entity, call it Cayo Perico Beach TV:

Volume: 100

sameRoom: 2.4

diffRoom: 6.0

Range: 40

In the future, any TV settings you want, save it as an entity. Saving it as model will save those settings for that TV, everywhere around the map.

CONTENTS:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



The ymap files contains over 200 lights to brighten up Cayo Perico.

There are 100 seperate ymaps to avoid having 200+ props loaded in by a singular ymap.

The ymaps consist of:

- Runway lights and a helipad

- Street lights around the main roads of the island

- Mansion Pool improvement and solid sun loungers, beach ball, floatie, tables and chairs etc

- Side doors opened and lift doors removed

- Animal cage door opened

- "working" lighthouse

- Illuminated Boat Shed near party area and beached whale

- Illuminated skull near grave, opposite party area

And much much more


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- Illuminated beach party area with buoys, DJ stand lights, bar lights and TVs - TVs are to work with pmms script. Again, this is NOT provided.

SCRIPTS:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


cayo_perico_entitysets.lua: 


This script contains the entity sets for El Rubio's safe.

You can request to have either the Pearl Necklace, Panther, or Pink Diamond appear in the safe under Rubio's mansion. 

You must only request ONE set at a time. (example, "pearl_necklace_set" and "pearl_necklace_set,1".

Stop the resource, clear cache, then change your desired entityset, save the lua file and start the resource again. It should appear in game.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

cp_config.lua:


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


This script contains all the IPLs and natives for making the island appear as well as Los Santos in your server.
However, when you approach Cayo Perico, Los Santos will be concealed.
There may be some bugs when noclipping there too fast, teleporting, spectating a player 
or teleporting someone to you. If you happen to be on the island; Unfortunately I haven't found a solution 
to this as the natives were never intended for allowing players to freely explore Cayo Perico in freeroam, 
hence the majority of the FiveM playerbase who are frustrated about the long loading times due to the island resource
and can't be bothered with the hopper, as it takes away the freedom to RP and fly/drive a boat to/from the island.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

cayo_perico_entitysets.lua
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Responsible for spawning in heist props in El Rubio's Safe. You can decide which one to show


HANGAR COLLISIONS:
-------------------


The hangar collision is now in it's own seperate zip folder, so that the server doesn't read it.

The reason this is, is because if you happen to have the 'Cayo Perico Shops' resource, as well as mine, the server refuses to read the
collsion file for shops, but instead, read mine.

If you decide to put the shops into your server, use their collision.

If you don't have the shops, you can use my collision file.
