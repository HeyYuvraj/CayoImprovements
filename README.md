# CayoImprovements üèùÔ∏è

Designed for RP and exploration in mind, CayoImprovements enhances the island by removing obstructing collisions, adds more vegetation, street lights, heist props and socializing opportunities. 

This is a passion project of mine that began in December of 2020 to self teach myself Codewalker and has been constantly updated and developed since. 

I hope you enjoy üòä

---------------------------------------

# **REQUIREMENTS** ‚öôÔ∏è

- **Latest recommended artifacts** [for Windows](https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_server_windows/master/) **or** [for Linux](https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_proot_linux/master/)

-  [Gamebuild 2189 or higher](https://forum.cfx.re/t/tutorial-forcing-gamebuild-to-casino-cayo-perico-or-tuners-update/4784977)

- [Poodle Multimedia Script](https://github.com/kibook/pmms) **for the TV at the Beach Party.** 

> By default, PMMS is set to admin only 
> access, you can change this in the 
> permissions.cfg provided with it, if you 
> would prefer all players can access it.
>
> you will need to read pmms installation 
> instructions on the GitHub repository, and if you
> can't figure it out, open an issue.

> I'm **not** here to hold your hand.

---------------------------------------

**If you want the TV at the beach party to fade out nicely at a certain point, try these settings, then go to advanced settings and save it as an entity, call it Cayo Perico Beach TV:**

> Volume: 100
> 
> sameRoom: 2.4
> 
> diffRoom: 6.0
> 
> Range: 40

**In the future, any TV settings you want, save it as an entity. Saving it as model will save those settings for that TV, everywhere around the map.**

# BUGS üêõ

Due to the hangar being **modified** and additional props placed inside, having both islands active *(via removing the native)*, causes an issue with the hangar appearing.

 ‚ö†Ô∏è **TELEPORTING TO AND FROM THE ISLAND **MAY** CAUSE ISSUES. USE A BRIDGE, PLANE, HELICOPTER OR BOAT** ‚ö†Ô∏è


---------------------------------------

# Vehicles üöò

**"No Vehicles" and "No Flight Or Water Vehicles" options updated and provided. Drag and drop the files you require into the CayoImprovements `ymap` folder.**

---------------------------------------

# **HANGAR COLLISIONS:**

The hangar collision is now in it's own separate zip folder, so that the server doesn't read it.

The reason this is, is because if you happen to have the '"[Cayo Perico Shops MLO](https://forum.cfx.re/t/mlo-cayo-perico-shops/1994908)' resource, as well as mine, the server refuses to read the collision file for shops, but instead, read mine, making the shop collisions not work. 

Just copy and paste mine, or the Cayo Perico Shops collision file **(h4_islandairstrip_12)** into the ybn 

---------------------------------------

# Frameworks & Other Cayo Perico Resources / Scripts Support:

I don't use any fancy frameworks or any other Cayo Perico related resources, so you'll have to troubleshoot it on your **own.** These are simply ymaps, therefore you may need to update the fxmanifest version to something newer, and then it should be good to go.

Check any collision (ybn) files of your maps if you face any conflictions.
